# Overview

- I'll be using the Common Lisp language (next year maybe I'll try another one)

- Each day will be associated with a different branch (`d01`, `d02`, etc.)

- I'll use libraries if necessary, as a way to show what can be done in actual programs

- I'll comment the code to explain difficulties, but some knowledge of Lisp is assumed

- To avoid unhealthy behaviours and because I don't have much spare
  time, and also because it's supposed to be fun, I won't be forcing
  myself to post a solution each day, I'll allow to let the challenge
  end in January if necessary.
